# CSharp-Duck-Hunt
Last revision of code: July 2015

Preface: This code is old and is not a good representation of the programmer I am now. However, I still want to show that I do enjoy programming and that I do have side projects. I am currently going over my code from High School and choosing projects to refactor.

Description: This is a copy of the original NES Duck Hunt written in C# and XNA.

Runable: The publish/ directory contains all files to install and run the game on another computer.
